# US-Census-Data-on-Salary-vs-Demographics-Regression-Study
This was developed using STATA as part of Econometrics final project. See PDF for full report.

### Motivation
A few months ago, I faced the difficult decision of enrolling into graduate school at
USC or starting my full-time job at Ernst & Young (E&Y). I was very grateful to have
these choices but felt that either decision would determine my career for at least the
next five years. This prompted me to question, which option would result to having
the higher yearly compensation and to what extent would other factors affect my
salary? Hence, I developed an econometric model that focuses on compensation
salary in the United States versus age and other influential variables such as race,
gender, education, and region.

### Data Selection
I used 2019 public U.S. Census Data on Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual
Social and Economic (ASEC) Supplement. The data focuses on the person record
type and I renamed many variables from the provided data dictionary to help make
the model more understandable (See STATA code in Appendix for variables
renamed). Because the data was from the U.S. Census Survey, many important
explanatory variables such as tenure-level, years in the work force, or cost of living, 

### Conclusion
Age is positively correlated with salary; however, age starts to have a diminishing
effect on salary after the age of ~53 years old. I have determined that gender, race,
educational degree, and the region of work are all significantly correlated with salary.
Workers with a graduate degree are also expected to make more than those who
hold only a bachelorâ€™s degree. These results largely appear to be consistent with
findings from other research studies. Since this is also an observational study, I can
only conclude correlation rather than causation. Moving forward, an inclusion of
additional explanatory variables (i.e. years in the work force, tenure level, etc.) would
further strengthen the model.
